# TripleDot-TechnicalArtTest
Andres GR Technical Art Test

Unity version:
2022.3.59f1

Some part of the current test content are created using edited external packages:
Easy Text Effects - https://github.com/LeiQiaoZhi/Easy-Text-Effects-for-Unity.git
Hyper Casual FX - https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/vfx/particles/hyper-casual-fx-200333

In order to create the different C# scripts I used ChatGPT and Claude. I understand the logic I need behind but I'm not good with the code gramatics so AI covers now my weakness.

There is a basic shadergraph in the project. Since this test doesn't need very complex shaders I cannot show all I'm learning now regarding this. Just to inform that this topic calls my interest at this moment.

I've added an extra dynamic that doesn't covers the test document; You can hide and show the main menu footer by sweeping the finger/pointer up and down, but only in the bottom third of the screen to avoid possible conflicts with other buttons.
